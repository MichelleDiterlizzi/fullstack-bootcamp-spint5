## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage

> **You do NOT need to have Laravel installed globally.**  
> All dependencies are managed via Composer.

### 1. Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher (with extensions: `mbstring`, `openssl`, `pdo`, `tokenizer`, `xml`, `sodium`, `gd`)
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
- MySQL (for development)
- SQLite (for testing, in-memory)
- Git (recommended)
- XAMPP or similar stack for Windows users

### 2. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sprint5-event-api.git
cd sprint5-event-api
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
composer install
```

If you get an error about the `ext-sodium` or `ext-gd` extension, enable them in your `php.ini`:
- Open your `php.ini` (e.g. `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`)
- Find `;extension=sodium` and/or `;extension=gd` and remove the `;`
- Save and restart Apache

### 4. Environment setup

Copy the example environment file and generate the app key:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Database setup

By default, the **application uses MySQL**.  
Make sure your `.env` file has the correct MySQL settings, for example:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sprint5_api_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

- Create the database `sprint5_api_db` in your MySQL server before running migrations.
- You can use phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the command line:

  ```sh
  mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE sprint5_api_db;"
  ```

> **Note:**  
> The automated tests use an in-memory SQLite database, so you do **not** need to configure SQLite for development.

### 6. Run migrations and seeders

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 7. Install Passport

```sh
php artisan passport:install
```
If prompted to run pending migrations and you get an error like `table already exists`, see the Troubleshooting section below.

---

## üß™ Running the API (optional)

If you want to run the API locally (for manual testing):

```sh
php artisan serve
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## üß™ Running Feature Tests

**This is the main way to verify the API.**

```sh
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
```

Or simply:

```sh
php artisan test
```

All tests in [`tests/Feature`](tests/Feature) will be executed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Duplicate Passport Migration Files

If you see errors like `table 'oauth_auth_codes' already exists` during migrations or tests, you may have duplicate Passport migration files.  
**Solution:**  
- Check your `database/migrations` folder.
- Keep only one migration file for each Passport table (`oauth_auth_codes`, `oauth_access_tokens`, etc.).
- Delete any duplicates (files with similar names but different timestamps).

### GD Extension Not Installed

If you get an error like `GD extension is not installed`, PHP is missing the GD extension (used for image processing).

**How to enable GD in XAMPP (Windows):**
1. Open `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`
2. Find the line `;extension=gd` or `;extension=gd2`
3. Remove the `;` at the beginning to uncomment it:
   ```
   extension=gd
   ```
4. Save the file.
5. Restart Apache from the XAMPP control panel.

### Other Common Issues

- **ext-sodium missing:** Enable `extension=sodium` in your `php.ini`.
- **Tests fail due to database:** Make sure your `phpunit.xml` contains:
  ```xml
  <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
  <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
  ```
- **Cache issues:** Run `php artisan config:clear` and `php artisan cache:clear`.
